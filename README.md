# App Store Submission Checklists

A set of practical checklists for iOS developers to prepare their apps (new or updates) for App Store Review and avoid common rejection reasons. Based on my experience (10+ apps live in the App Store), I put this together as a way to avoid unnecessary rejections and save time.

## Why this exists

As an indie developer, I’ve submitted quite a few apps to the App Store. Even after 10+ launches, it’s easy to overlook something—big or small—and lose days to a rejection that could have been prevented.

These checklists grew out of my own workflow as a way to catch and prevent App Store review issues before hitting “Submit.” I’m sharing it in case it helps others avoid the same mistakes, especially if you’re shipping solo or on a small team.

## How to use this

1. Pick the checklist below that matches your submission type.
2. Run through that checklist before you submit your app for review.
3. Check off each item, or make notes on what’s missing.
4. If you spot something that should be added or improved, open an issue or pull request.

## The Checklists

There are two checklists in this repo:

- **[Checklist for New App Submissions](CHECKLIST_NEW_APP.md):** Use this if you’re submitting a brand new app to the App Store.
- **[Checklist for App Updates](CHECKLIST_APP_UPDATE.md):** Use this if you’re submitting an update to an app that’s already live.

Pick the one that fits your situation and work through each item before you submit.
